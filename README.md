# ArduinoBomber

Requires MPU6050 and servo library.
This code requres hardware arduino nano, mpu6050, sg90 servo.

Device should be mounted on a drone. Device recognizes specific gesture as rotaring continuosly for 5 seconds widhout interrupt.
When gesture is recognized - device lights led, opens servo lock, and provides additional signal to ignite the payload.

Kinda DIY drone bomber.
